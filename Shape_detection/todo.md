- update the docs
- ---- submission ----
- update the polyhedron demo
- add new tests: polyline (2D, 3D), polyline with sorting (2D, 3D), free functions, randomness, strict tests on the data from PMP, tests similar to the basic_example
- ---- algorithm ----
- create the polyline graph
- create face to index map
- create face to region map
- iterate over all edges
  - skip those, which have the same region neighbor
  - preserve the boundary edges
  - for each valid edge set its index as a neighbor for the source and target vertex
  - use std map to map the index from the global range of vertices to the polyline vertices
  - for each vertex save neighbor regions as well
- create the neighbor query based on the saved neighbors
- create the region type based on the neighbor regions
  - skip corners (have more than 2 neighbors)
  - split all other vertices into regions connecting corners
  - corners will be returned as unassigned items
- simplify the graph using the polyline regions
  - iterate over all vertices in each region
  - find the corner vertices for each region (must be two)
  - if both corners are boundary, use region growing to detect linear segments
  - insert boundary points of each linear segment as new corners
  - map each corner to the region and take the opposite corner index (each region has max two corners)
  - this creates new vertex range with neighbors
  - while creating vertices also insert edges with neighbor regions
  - based on the vertices and edges create oriented faces by possibly using sorting on Direction_2
  - these faces are not necessary convex
  - move each face vertex to the position of the intersection point between all neighbor region planes
  - triangulate each face and tag exterior triangles beyond its boundaries, which are constraints in CDT
- that gives the new simplified surface mesh
