This CGAL package implements the Efficient RANSAC (RANdom SAmple Consensus) algorithm
for detecting shapes in a point set with unoriented normals. Five canonical shapes
can be detected: planes, spheres, cylinders, cones, and tori.
Additional shapes can be detected, given a custom shape class by the user.

In addition to the RANSAC algorithm, the generic Region Growing algorithm is implemented.
This algorithm can detect shapes in a set of arbitrary items. In particular,
CGAL provides five instances of the algorithm: detecting lines in a 2D point set,
detecting planes in a 3D point set, detecting planes on a polygon mesh, detecting lines
in a 2D/3D segment set, and detecting lines on a 2D/3D polyline.
Other custom instances can be easily added by the user.
